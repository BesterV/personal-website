                <h1 class="title">What to do when you grow up?</h1>
                <p>Are you one of the millions of people that at the age of 35 still wonder what they want to do when they &quot;grow up&quot;? Are you struggling to figure out what exactly excites you and motivates you to get up in the morning? Well, join the club.</p>
                <p>Ever since I graduated high school, the thought of what to do with the rest of my life has always haunted me. When I graduated from University it only got worse. You would expect someone who graduates with a specific degree would have a good idea of what to do with their life. Well according to this article, 78% of people in their 20s are interested in a career change. Basically what it boils down to is that most people are not fortunate enough to know exactly what they want to do when they finish school. Worst still, it doesn&#39;t seem to improve that much over time.</p>
                <p>I have found a number of problems that give rise to this predicament:</p>
                <h2 id="struggling-to-find-their-passion">Struggling to find their passion</h2>
                <p>I have made the habit of asking people (especially high schoolers) what they want to do when they graduate. I have also asked people what they would do if they won the lottery and they didn&#39;t have to work anymore. I have rarely gotten an answer other than &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.</p>
                <p>People don&#39;t really know what to do with their lives. One possible reason for this is that we are presented with so many options for careers and we don&#39;t really know which one will best suit us. We sometimes don&#39;t even know what these options will entail. Do you know what it&#39;s like to be a lawyer, a doctor, an engineer, an athlete, an accountant or an actuary on a day to day basis? You may sometimes think you know based on movies you&#39;ve watch, but that&#39;s rarely accurate. You are thus left to pick what you will be studying for the next 4 to 6 years and you&#39;re not even sure you&#39;ll like it.</p>
                <p>Another possible reason is that people don&#39;t tend to try new things. For example, people might say that they don&#39;t like to - or cannot - paint. When asked about it further, it turns out that they haven&#39;t even painted much in their life. How do you know you don&#39;t like something if you haven&#39;t tried it enough? I use to word enough, as sometimes things get better as you improve. It&#39;s no fun to play tennis if you suck at it, but as you get better, the better the game becomes.</p>
                <p>The reality is that most of the time, a passion is discovered by doing something. When my brother first showed me how to program, I wasn&#39;t really that interested. It seemed too complicated. However, over time as I practiced and developed (pun intended) a love for it.</p>
                <h2 id="too-many-interests-unable-to-focus">Too many interests / unable to focus</h2>
                <p>I have always been a dreamer ever since I was little kid. My mind would always venture off on some future version of myself. I would dream I was a writer or a photographer. I would dream I started my own software company. I would dream of being an athlete. You see the problem is I have a lot of things that I find interesting. This however makes me unable to focus on one thing and actually get anything done.</p>
                <p>I will start off by focusing on photography for example. After taking a couple of photos and editing them, I would get slightly bored and start creating a website or start writing, etc.</p>
                <p>Now the problem with jumping around between interests is that you rarely get a good product in the end. One good photo doesn&#39;t make you a good photographer, one good blog post doesn&#39;t make you a good blogger. It is the consistent repetition of the task that will end up defining who you are.</p>
                <h2 id="waiting-for-the-opportunity">Waiting for the opportunity</h2>
                <p>A lot of people are stuck in their jobs because they are waiting for some opportunity to drop before them. I have heard people saying that they would like to start a coffee shop. However, I know they will never open one. I know because they haven&#39;t made any effort to even remotely begin one. They don&#39;t even know where they will open it, how much it will cost (rent, machinery, staff, coffee beans, etc.), they number of client&#39;s they can expect, the feasibility of the project, etc. If you haven&#39;t taken the time and effort to even dive in and dig into what you want to accomplish, you will never get started. It is a dream that will always remain just that... a dream.</p>
                <h2 id="afraid-of-the-risks">Afraid of the risks</h2>
                <p>I&#39;ve joked with one of my friends that I wished that I got laid off and was basically forced to start living my dream. The problem with having a job with a decent pay, is that you have something to risk. I don&#39;t want to leave my job just to go and fail at something else is what a lot of people tell themselves. What will other people think of my decision? I will be branded an idiot for doing so.</p>
                <p>What people tend to forget is that there is a risk in standing still. The opportunities missed because you didn&#39;t take a chance is often times bigger than the failures that you are afraid off. A lot of billionaires have mentioned that they knew that if they failed, they could eventually just join another company as an employee and still make a decent living. This is especially true when you&#39;re young.</p>
                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>To conclude, I want to urge you (and myself for that matter), to strive towards what we set out for ourselves. Don&#39;t be afraid to try new things and don&#39;t let the fear of failure stop you. Also don&#39;t just dream about something, act now! You only have so much time on earth. Don&#39;t waste it.</p>
